[Web App](https://smart-nfts.gonzalohirsch.com/) to automatically create, deploy, test, and view custom NFT Smart Contracts in just minutes. You can mint tokens and share them via Testnets and marketplaces like OpenSea.

Built using Vue 3 + Vite for the front-end and Serverless + TypeScript for the back-end. Hosted on AWS using a serverless API and an S3 bucket for the web app. Distributed using Cloudfront for API acceleration and front-end caching.

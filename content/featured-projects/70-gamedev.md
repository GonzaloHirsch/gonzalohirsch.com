Multiple games I developed as a freelancer and for entertainment. These games include:
- [Fusecore](https://fusecore.gonzalohirsch.com/) is a First Person Shooter based on a Search & Destroy game mode.
- [Asteroids](https://asteroids.gonzalohirsch.com/) is a copy of the arcade classic.
- [Duck Fight](https://jousting.nonco.gonzalohirsch.com/) is a duck jousting game based on the NFTs from the [Nonconformist Ducks](https://nonconformistducks.com/) collection.
- [Jason Mask Fight](https://jason.nonco.gonzalohirsch.com/) is a tournament simulation fight game based on the NFTs from the [Nonconformist Ducks](https://nonconformistducks.com/) collection.

This [repository](https://github.com/GonzaloHirsch/ai-ml) contains implementations of multiple Neural Network designs and some search algorithms such as A*. Each codebase focuses on solving a particular problem. Neural Network designs are single perceptron, multilayer perceptron, Kohonen network, Oja network, and Autoencoders.

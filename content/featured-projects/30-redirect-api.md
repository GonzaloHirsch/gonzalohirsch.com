A serverless API, similar to bit.ly, under my domain (`redirect.gonzalohirsch.com`) used to add custom redirects to pages I want. It was built as a hobby using AWS services such as API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudFront, Route 53, and CloudWatch. Some example URLs are:

* [redirect.gonzalohirsch.com/github](https://redirect.gonzalohirsch.com/github)

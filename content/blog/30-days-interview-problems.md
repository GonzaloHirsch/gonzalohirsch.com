We all know that interviewing for jobs can be difficult, especially in tech companies where engineers have to solve complex problems in a short amount of time. I've been through many coding interview questions, in real-life interviews, and on websites that host practice questions. While I was successful on many, like Google and Toptal, I've also failed on others, such as Facebook. That's why I'm embarking on a new personal challenge, the "**30 Days of Interview Problems**" challenge.

## Motivation

Any great software engineer can design (great) solutions to a technical question in no time. We could say that ability comes from understanding the theory behind the algorithms and having a vast repertoire of past algorithms and questions to make associations between them. Being able to do this is key to being successful in a coding interview.

I'm aware I can improve my programming skills, and as we all know, "_Practice makes perfect._". Right now is the perfect opportunity to do so. The question is how much I can improve in that time, and using a sample interview question and keeping track of my progress through this blog is the best way to do so.

The objective of this challenge is to ace any programming interview or coding problem thrown at me during any interview process.

## The Challenge

The idea is to **solve at least two interview problems per day** from websites like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), and [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/). I will update this post to add the problems I solve each day, and I'll publish one post per day with any question I solve, the solutions I find, and my insights on the algorithms.

I'll be coding in Java, my favorite programming language for designing a data structure and solving algorithmic problems, for practice and any job interview.

The challenge will **start on the 25th of July** and **end on the 24th of August**. Yes, I couldn't wait for the 1st of August; I know I'll be bored otherwise.

## Focus

The main focus of the challenge will be on interview preparation for any technical interview I might see. Although by the end of it, I might shift to using a mock interview to test myself on a real-life interview scenario.

Each question will probably be in the algorithm category, which includes any data structure (like a binary tree), search algorithm (such as binary search or dynamic programming algorithms), or simply a coding question. I have seen questions on system design focused on concurrency, so I'll keep an eye on those. Data science is not my specialization, so solving any coding interview question in that field is not an option.
